## Phase 2: Send results to database to support interaction analysis and dataset opensource(Table,Graph,etc.)

## Phase 3: MEV FSS Research

An reference solution:

`Fair Sequencing Services (FSS) : Chainlinkâ€™s functionality to bring
blockchain users the innovation of first-come, first-serve services like the kind
